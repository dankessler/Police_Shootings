Crowell told investigators he drew his gun and yelled, “Drop the knife!” He said Hill then cocked his arm and took a step toward him. Crowell said he believed “for certain” that Hill was going to throw the knife.

NVClark,10/8/2014 11:59:50,7/14/2011,NV - Nevada,Clark,Las Vegas Valley,Metro Police,Rafael Alonso Olivas,23,Male,Unknown,Hispanic or Latino origin,Hispanic,1,Killed,Armed,Knife or cutting instrument,"Three Metro Police officers fatally shot a 23-year-old man wielding a butcher knife Thursday morning in a western Las Vegas Valley neighborhood.

Police responded at 6:46 a.m. to the report of a domestic disturbance on Musical Lane near the intersection of Firestone Drive and Westcliff Drive. That location is southwest of the Buffalo Drive and Summerlin Parkway interchange.

Metro Police Capt. Patrick Neville said a woman reported she was having an argument with her son and that he was out of control.

Police arrived and found a man with a butcher knife walking southbound on Firestone Drive. Neville said the man approached officers after authorities made several commands for him to stop.

The officers then discharged non-lethal rounds at the man, striking him four times, in an attempt to get him to stop, but the man continued toward officers with the knife, Neville said.

""Officers feared for their lives,"" he said.

The three officers then fired multiple shots at the man, who was pronounced dead at University Medical Center. Neville said he didn't know how close the officers were to the man when they opened fire.

Victor Chavez, the man's cousin, identified the man who was killed as Rafael Olivas.

Chavez, 21, described his cousin’s relationship with his mother as fairly typical, with arguments only once in a while.

“I still can’t believe it,” he said. “It hasn’t set in.”

Chavez said one of the last times he saw Olivas — known as “Ralfy” to relatives — was during a party for a younger family member. Olivas lived with his mother and has several siblings, he said.

Police said the mother wasn't injured during the argument with her son. It wasn’t immediately clear whether other family members were home at the time or what led to the argument.

“All I heard was he had a knife,” said Chavez, who rushed to join family at the scene after the shooting. “That’s no reason to be shot four times.”

The three officers involved were placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard procedure for officer-involved shootings. Their names will be released in 48 hours.",http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jul/14/metro-police-involved-shooting-western-valley/,,Yes,2,No thanks.,,,,7/14/2011,1,This is the first incident I am logging.

However, details have been disputed by witnesses, who say that the officers never spoke in Spanish (the victim did not speak English), that he had his hands above his head while leaning against a wall as if surrendering, and that all he did was turn around.  The victim may also have been the person who was assaulted in the first place.

The police refused to let bystanders video the crime scene.

Allison Donnelly, 42, called the police after confronting an intruder — who was wearing a scarf over his face and holding some sort of weapon — on the first floor of the home she shares with three children and her mother, she said. The police said the intruder was Mr. Doerbecker.

Ms. Donnelly’s house is across the street from the Doerbeckers’. The intruder fled out the front door when she yelled, she said. Officers connected the investigative dots and soon went to the Doerbeckers’, where they tried but failed to have Kurt Doerbecker come out after speaking with him and his father, Lieutenant Smith said.

At that point, police officers took up positions around the house, Lieutenant Smith said. At least 20 officers initially responded, he said. Three of them were on the north side of the home when they saw a man exit through a ground-floor window. One officer was ultimately “forced to fire,” the police said.

An autopsy on Mr. Doerbecker conducted on Tuesday showed that a single bullet hit him in the head, according to a law enforcement official, though the precise entry point was not immediately clear.

The information below is from the police reports and witness statements.  I'd be happy to email the police reports, investigations and witness statements if Deadspin would like to review the evidence itself.

Police were called because a neighbor believed 4 teenagers were smoking pot in an apartment complex's laundry room.  The sheriff's office responded to the call because it was in the unincorporated part of Vista, California.  A 25 year old female, alone, approached the four people.  There was no signs of pot.  Nevertheless, Deputy Storms decided to do a warrant check.  She handcuffed one of the individuals and sat him down on the curb outside the laundry room.  She went to handcuff the victim, who asked why he was being arrested.  She told him to shut up or she would tase him.  He then looked over his shoulder at her and she told him to turn around or she was going to tase him.  She then bear hugged him.  The victim (5'7"" 190lbs  (arrest records indicate 5'8"" 220lbs, of course)), then tried to get away believing he was about to be tased.  He pushed the officer out of the laundry room.  She still had him in the bear hug position as if she was about to suplex him.  The two fell to the ground, Deputy Storms falling on her back.  Witnesses state that the victim never once tried to strike Deputy Storms and was struggling to try to get away.  Deputy Storms discharged her taser during the fracas on the ground and the probes missed the victim but nearly hit the bystanders.  The victim got to his feet and began to run.  While he was at least 30 feet away, Deputy Storms shot him in the back.  The bullet entered about 4"" to the right of the spine, severed the victim's lung, liver and spleen and ultimately came to rest immediately behind his right nipple.  The victim spent weeks in the hospital recovering.

The following day, Deputy Storms said that she looked up from the sidewalk and saw the victim with her taser and believed he was about to shoot her.  The taser was on the ground about 40 feet from the victim at the time he was shot IN THE BACK, something that the journalists and officers doing the investigation fail to address in their coverage.",http://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/Shots-Fired-in-Vista-Primrose-Avenue-208596951.html,Deputy M Storms (Badge 6757),,,,,,,,,

Houston’s family told the deputies that Houston was living in the storage unit, was making irrational comments over the phone and on social networks, and was high on methamphetamine and armed. Deputies called Houston, and Houston said he would kill them and anyone else who tried to contact him.

The SWAT team was called in and a negotiator was able to talk Houston into coming out of the unit. Houston partially opened the garage door, but refused to cooperate with the SWAT team’s commands to put his hands on his head and turn around. SWAT members fired non-lethal projectiles at Houston in an attempt to subdue him, but the projectiles had no effect on Houston. He went back inside the unit and closed the door.

To prevent Houston from using his car that was parked in front of the door, SWAT members attempted to tow it away. As the team was hooking a cable to the vehicle, Houston began firing a gun through the garage door. One SWAT member was struck in the arm. Two other team members returned gunfire through the door with their rifles. The gunfire inside the storage unit stopped.

Team members attempted to contact Houston, but were unsuccessful. They entered the storage unit and found Houston deceased on the floor with a handgun and expended casings next to him.

According to Medical Examiner Dr. Thomas Clark, Houston died from a gunshot wound to his abdomen. Dr. Clark also determined Houston had methamphetamines, marijuana and oxycodone in his system at the time of his death.

He was driving home to his off-campus apartment from a bar when Carter said he noticed Redus weaving between lanes and decided to follow him, although he did not know the driver was a UIW student.

University officials have repeatedly claimed Carter had the right as a sworn police office to interrupt his late night food run to a nearby Whataburger and pursue Redus, even though he was off campus and did not know the driver was a UIW student. Carter has been on paid leave since the incident, and in its response to the civil lawsuit UIW officials defended his shooting of Redus as justified.

There are inconsistencies in Carter’s version of events from the point he began to follow Redus north on Broadway through Alamo Heights, but what is not in dispute is that Carter attempted to arrest Redus outside his apartment as he exited his vehicle and a scuffle ensued. Carter said Redus resisted arrest and fought with him before Carter finally fired six shots at close range, striking Redus five times.",http://www.therivardreport.com/uiw-semester-starts-with-protest-cameron-redus-shooting/,Christopher Carter,,,,,,,,,

Fabian Garza, 21, was driving a 1994 Cadillac El Dorado that rear-ended a white SUV early Friday in the drive-through of Chacho's, in the 8600 block of Perrin Beitel Road on the Northeast Side.

Garza tried to back up and leave the scene of the 1 a.m. wreck, according to police. The SUV's driver, whose identity is unknown, “exchanged words” with the people in the Cadillac and left the scene, according to police.

A witness told Officer Robert Encina of the San Antonio Police Department about the incident and added . Encina was in full uniform working an off-duty security job at the restaurant, of the incident, adding that the people in the Cadillac seemed intoxicated.

The witness said the officer repeatedly asked Garza to turn off the car and step outside the car. Garza and his passenger Marquise Jones, 23, were not following Encina's orders and Jones seemed to be reaching for something in the car, the witness told police.

Encina was able to turn off the car himself, and put the keys on the roof while trying to handcuff Garza, according to police.

At that point, police said Jones got out of the passenger door and pulled a revolver from the area of his waist, turning to look at Encina.

The witness said Encina then fired shots.

Jones started to run westward before collapsing, according to the police report.

An arriving officer found Jones lying face down toward Perrin Beitel road with a gunshot wound on the left side of his back. He was not breathing and was pronounced dead within minutes, according to police.

It has been reported that he lived alone and I couldn't find any mention of the police finding anyone else in the home.
